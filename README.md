Task and reward manager
This is a project for an android phone, to query a website for tasks. the tasks will result in rewards. This is initally being developed for my partners son who is altistic and to give him purpose and to help him raise money for his hobies. 
so this is the first time im playing with github. I have cloned and updated before while working for a broadcasting compnay, but never started a repository myself. 
lets see what happens.
